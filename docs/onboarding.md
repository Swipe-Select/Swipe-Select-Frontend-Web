# Onboarding — Swipe Select

Documents every step of the multi-screen onboarding flow that runs **after sign-up** when the user has a valid session. **`/onboarding` is protected** — unauthenticated users are sent to **`/login`**.

---

## Routes

| Route | Component | File |
|---|---|---|
| `/onboarding` | `OnboardingPage` | `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` |
| `/onboarding/complete` | `PostOnboardingPage` | `src/pages/PostOnboardingPage.tsx` |

---

## Architecture

`OnboardingPage` is a **single-page, step-driven component**. It holds a `step` integer in local state (`useState(0)`) and conditionally renders the correct screen based on that value. Steps advance via `next()` (`Math.min(step + 1, 12)`) and regress via `back()` (`Math.max(step - 1, 0)`).

```
step 0  → Identity
step 1  → Resume Upload
step 2  → Personal Info
step 3  → Notifications
step 4  → Work Experience
step 5  → Ready screen ("You're almost ready to swipe!")
step 6  → Role Selection
step 7  → Country / Visa Setup
step 8  → Location
step 9  → Target Locations
step 10 → Work Preference
step 11 → Employment Models
step 12 → Experience Level
         → /onboarding/complete
```
