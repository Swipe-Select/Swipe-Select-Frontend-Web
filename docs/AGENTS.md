## Routes

| Path | Component | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `WelcomePage` | Public | Landing page |
| `/welcome` | `WelcomePage` | Public | Alias for `/` |
| `/login` | `LoginPage` | Public | Email/password sign-in |
| `/signup` | `SignUpPage` | Public | Registration → session then `/onboarding` on success |
| `/onboarding` | `OnboardingPage` | **Required** | Steps 0–12 |
| `/onboarding/complete` | `PostOnboardingPage` | **Required** | Completion screen |
| `/discover` | `JobSwipePage` | **Required** | Job swipe UI |
| `*` | redirect | Public | Unknown path → `/` |

`ProtectedRoute` checks JWT in React context / `localStorage`; missing token → redirect to `/login`.

---

## Onboarding step map

`OnboardingPage` renders one step at a time using a local `step` integer (`useState(0)`). Steps are advanced with `next()` and reversed with `back()`.

| `step` | Screen |
|---|---|
| 0 | Identity (gender) |
| 1 | Resume Upload |
| 2 | Personal Info |
| 3 | Notifications |
| 4 | Work Experience |
| 5 | Ready ("You're almost ready to swipe!") |
| 6 | Role Selection |
| 7 | Country / Visa Setup |
| 8 | Location |
| 9 | Target Locations |
| 10 | Work Preference |
| 11 | Employment Models |
| 12 | Experience Level → `finish()` → `/onboarding/complete` |

See `docs/onboarding.md` for full step-by-step detail.

## Connectivity & known quirks

- **`View Profile`** on `/onboarding/complete` navigates to **`/`** (Welcome). There is **no `/profile` route yet** — copy on that button describes “completed profile”; product may add a dedicated profile route later.
- **Google OAuth** is wired in **`AuthContext` / backend** but the **Google button + `GoogleOAuthProvider` were removed from the UI** temporarily; flows are **email + password only** in-app.
- **Backend vs docs:** onboarding **resume extraction** accepts **PDF, 5 MB**; older copy sometimes mentioned DOCX/10 MB — **`docs/onboarding.md`** aligns with implementation.

## Brand & design conventions

### Colours (CSS custom properties on `.onb`)

| Variable | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--onb-brand` | `#4648d4` | All primary CTA buttons |
| `--onb-brand-hover` | `#3d3fbb` | Primary button hover |
| `--onb-indigo` | `#6366f1` | Secondary accent (selected states) |
| `--onb-slate-900` | `#0f172a` | Body text |
| `--onb-slate-600` | `#64748b` | Muted / sub-copy text |
| `--onb-slate-200` | `#e2e8f0` | Borders / dividers |
| `--onb-white` | `#ffffff` | Card backgrounds |
| `--onb-bg` | `#f8fafc` | Page background |

### Button classes

| Class | Description |
|---|---|
| `onb-btn` | Base reset (no border, no background) |
| `onb-btn-primary` | Filled pill — uses `--onb-indigo` |
| `onb-btn-primary--brand` | Override to `--onb-brand` (#4648d4) — **use this on all forward-navigation CTAs** |
| `onb-btn-ghost` | Transparent with no border — used for Back buttons |
| `onb-flex-gap` | `display:flex; gap:8px; align-items:center` utility |

### Primary button rule

Every "Continue", "Save Preferences", "Save Preference", "Save & Continue", "Save & Continue →", and "Continue to Profile" button **must** use both `onb-btn-primary` **and** `onb-btn-primary--brand`. Do not use inline `background` colours.

|---|---|
| "Identify as female / male / …" subtitle text under identity cards | Step 0 |
| Profile Setup sidebar (Basic Info / Identity / Experience) | Steps 0, 11 |
| "Step X of Y" text labels | Steps 7, 12 |
| Top gradient progress bar strips | Steps 1, 6, 9 |
| Segment pill progress indicators | Step 6 |
| Progress bar above Experience Level | Step 12 |
| "Polish with AI" button next to Description field | Step 4 |
| AI Assistant / Preview right sidebar | Step 4 |
| Analysis / Smart Matching Active right sidebar | Step 9 |
| "Save Changes" header button | Step 9 |
| "Skip Step" button | Step 7 |
| "Skip" button | Step 8 |

## Agent instructions

- Read `docs/auth.md` and `docs/onboarding.md` before editing any page in `src/pages/`.
- All primary CTA buttons must use `onb-btn-primary onb-btn-primary--brand`. Never use inline `background` hex values for brand buttons.
- Do not re-introduce any of the UI listed in the "What has been intentionally removed" table above.
- Do not modify `src/brand.ts` constants.
- Assets are managed via `src/figma/*.ts` files — all image URLs live there, not inline.
- Keep step numbering in `OnboardingPage` contiguous (0–12); do not add gaps.
- CSS for onboarding lives entirely in `OnboardingPage.css` using the `onb-*` namespace — do not add inline styles for things already covered by a utility class.
